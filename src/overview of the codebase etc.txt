some files
----------
    archive.lua:
        this is not used. do not use it.
        it is where i put code that i want to reference later but i do not want to use in the program.
        the goal is to not clutter the main thing with comments. you do not need to look here.

    conf.lua:
        required love2d thing for setting window settings and such.

    main.lua:
        uncategorized code, and also love.draw and such are contained here. brings everything together, more generally.
        it handles input and related actions right now too. this may change.

    gfx.lua:
        module for rendering things, generally speaking. things from it should be called from main.lua primarily.
        it also contains helper functions relating to e.g converting screen positions to/from tile positions.

    grid.lua:
        module that defines the grid, and relevant helper functions.

    sfx.lua:
        sound effect handling. though other things are responsible for calling it as of now.
---------------------------------
some decisions you might question
---------------------------------
    things like this (look to grid.lua, for instance):

        local M = {}
        M.__index = M

        function M.new()
            local new = {}
            setmetatable(new, M)
            return new
        end

        function M:method(whatever)
            return stuff
        end
    
    the reason i am doing this is such that you can do things like:

        local module = require("the thing")
        local thing = module.new()
        thing:stuff(33295082395)
    
    hopefully that explains that.

    you might also wonder why everything is so bad and awful. that's because i wrote it.
